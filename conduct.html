<h1>ZNC86 Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
  <strong>TL;DR</strong>
  Make friends not enemies.
  Strive for kindness, be polite, assume others are acting in good faith, be
  gracious when others are not.
  Do not tolerate assholes, negativity, report harassment and hate.
  Act like you'll meet these people face-to-face tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Diversity: Everyone is Welcome</strong>
  We are inclusive and committed to being a community that everyone feels good
  about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always
  work to treat everyone well.
