    <h1>ZNC86 Code of Conduct</h1>

    <p>Last updated 2022/11/21</p>

    <p>
      <strong>TL;DR</strong>
      Make friends not enemies. Strive for kindness, be polite, assume others
      are acting in good faith, be gracious when others are not. Do not tolerate
      assholes, negativity, report harassment and hate. Act like you'll meet
      these people face-to-face tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Diversity: Everyone is Welcome</strong>
      We are inclusive and committed to being a community that everyone feels
      good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we
      will always work to treat everyone well.
    </p>

    <p>This Code of Conduct applies IRL and online.</p>
