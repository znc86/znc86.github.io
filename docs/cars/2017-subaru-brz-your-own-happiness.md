It had been five years since I had owned a track car, it was the early months of
the COVID-19 pandemic, I was languishing, and my wife said

> ‟You need to do something, **you need to make your own happiness**”

I needed to do something for myself, to have my own thing.

I started looking for a fun, rear-wheel drive sports coupes, 350Zs, RX-8, I considered the Miata, but it wasn't for me.
I had liked the FR-S/86/BRZ triplets since they came out.
They reminded me of an older Subaru era I idolized but could never have:
Subaru Type RA and Spec C cars that were about committing to a purpose than chasing metrics.
No leather dashboards, no pumped up power figures, just a light, responsive chassis sharpened for the driver who cared enough to use it for
its intended purpose and who would be rewarded for driving with skill.

After a six-month search I found a used Crystal White Pearl late-model
Kouki (2017-2020) BRZ at a dealership in Annapolis Maryland.

I called Annapolis Subaru and immediately put down a cash deposit. I rented a car and
drove from Boston on a Friday night, starting at 10pm. I pulled up eleven hours later, at 9am Saturday
morning.
The car was in great condition, it idled with that signature Subaru rumble, muted through the stock exhaust,
the tach vibrating steady as if it had nothing to prove. Lucky for me, this was _just_ before
COVID-19 caused used-car prices to skyrocket.
I bought the car the same day and drove it home.

So far the car has handled 40+ track days like a champ, with only a few minor issues.
It’s making 188 wheel horsepower, keeping reliability and affordability in check.
Power would stay modest and naturally aspirated; reliability and feel would come first.
The BRZ did not need to be the fastest car at any track day—it needed to be the car I never got tired of driving.
It’s fulfilling its intended role as a driver’s car.

As the build evolved, so did my community around it.
What started as solitary efforts working on the streets gradually became small gatherings in my garage.
A friend dropped by to help bleed brakes; another came by to lend a hand mounting the STI wing before a track event.
A local Subaru meetup invited me to join, talking camber settings and tire choices.
The BRZ gave me a reason to show up, but the conversations gave me something I had been missing:
a sense of belonging not based on job title or accomplishments, but on shared passion.

There were setbacks, too.
A failed throwout bearing at a track day, a missed shift point that put me into a tire wall.
Each problem forced me back into the process.
Build, break, fix.
Over time, I began to notice how differently I responded to these challenges compared to work.
At the office, setbacks triggered anxiety and self-doubt.
In the garage, problems felt like puzzles.
The difference was ownership, and complete involvement.
The car was mine—not just in the legal sense, but in the sense that every decision, every bolt,
every compromise or refusal to compromise was my decision.

The BRZ gave me a practice of self-directed work, one where the metrics were not imposed but chosen.
I could decide, on any given weekend, whether “good” meant shaving a second off a lap, perfecting a heel-toe sequence,
or simply finishing a maintenance task that had been bothering me for months.

![Wingless style](/cars/2017-subaru-brz-your-own-happiness/wingless.jpg)

I named the car “Your Own Happiness” not because I expected the car to deliver on its namesake,
but the car was a canvas I could feel, a project of complete involvement with a feedback loop measured
in tire wear, lap times, and hours under the car.
The car itself isn't what would make me happy, its the _involvement_ in
creating the vision come to life—the _participation_ in motorsports,
and of course the people and friends I make along the way.

“Your Own Happiness” will never become a show car, never win awards, and that suits me fine.
The paint has track scars, the wheel faces collect dust and baked-on rubber.
Underneath, though, the parts tell a coherent story: a deliberately built 2017 Subaru BRZ, tuned for balance,
reliability, and a driver who values participation over spectatorship.

Some details on the build:

## Engine

I started where many Subaru owners do: the exhaust and headers.
The factory unequal-length manifold had a certain nostalgic rumble,
but it strangled the midrange and left some power on the table.
Swapping to a Tomei Japan Expreme Ti equal-length header with a Fujitsubo Authorize R TypeS exhaust turned the
soundtrack from silenced purr into a lumpy rumble that is assertive over 4000 RPM but wont anger the neighbors.

![Engines room](/cars/2017-subaru-brz-your-own-happiness/engines-room.jpg)

The ECU tune tied everything together.
With the header and exhaust in place, a conservative calibration on 93 octane via ECUTek nudged the FA20 to
188 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque at the wheels, but the real improvement lived in the curve, not the peak.
The midrange dip smoothed out, throttle response sharpened, and the car pulled more cleanly from corner to corner.
It was still, by any modern standard, a modest number, and that was precisely the point.
The BRZ remained a car that demanded momentum and rewarded discipline.
It did not let me hide behind excess, it requires finesse and rewards consistency.

## Drivetrain

![Transmission with BattleGarage RS throwout bearing and Verus clutch fork](/cars/2017-subaru-brz-your-own-happiness/drivetrain.jpg)

The drivetrain has slowly grown more serious.
A 1.5-way Cusco limited-slip differential replaced the stock unit, installed and shimmed by Tailored Chassis Solutions,
providing more consistent behavior under power and on corner entry.
Engine and transmission mounts, along with key bushings, were upgraded to firmer Cusco pieces,
trading a bit more vibration for clearer feedback during transitions.
This was not the sort of thing a casual passenger would notice, but I did.
Each time I tipped into the throttle at corner exit, the car’s response had less slop, less delay.
It was like speaking a second language with fewer pauses.

## Suspension/Brakes

I wanted a more precise connection, something that could survive the heat cycles and curbing abuse of track days
without turning the commute into a punishment.
Öhlins Road & Track coilovers became the centerpiece of the suspension,
chosen as much for their consistency as for their adjustability and maintainability.

![Öhlins Road & Track coilovers custom valved](/cars/2017-subaru-brz-your-own-happiness/suspension.jpg)

Öhlins Road & Track coilovers custom valved,
Swift springs with helpers,
SPL rear lower control arms,
OEM knuckles modified for more steering angle,
SKP (extended) tie rods,
Hotchkiss front endlinks,
H&R 15mm spacers,
Cusco front strut bar w/master cylinder stopper,
DBA 5000-series 2-piece front rotors,
Spiegler braided steel brake lines,
CounterSpace CSG Spec C1 & C11 pads,
ARP extended wheel studs,
Muteki SR48 open-ended lug nuts.

On track, the changes were transformative.
With the Öhlins paired to sticky tires, turn-in sharpened, body roll trimmed, and the car’s breakaway became more
predictable.
Under the braking markers, the pedal—now pushing fluid through braided lines to DBA rotors and CSG pads—felt firmer
and more communicative.
A set of ARP wheel studs and fresh hardware meant repeated heat cycles and tire swaps would not end in sheared-off
fasteners, especially with the wheel spacers.
Where the stock car feels a little vague at the limit, this version spoke to me in complete sentences.

## Interior

![Interior](/cars/2017-subaru-brz-your-own-happiness/interior.jpg)

The build was not purely about speed.
I paid equal attention to the small details that would make the car a place I wanted to be in for long stretches.
A Bride Zeta IV driver’s seat, bolted low and tight, anchored my body in a way the stock seat never could.
A Momo steering wheel on a Works Bell quick-release hub brought the controls closer to my chest,
aligning my posture with the car’s controls.
A Verus throttle pedal spacer corrected the awkward OEM pedal geometry and transformed heel-toe downshifts from
awkward fumbling into a casual reflex.
