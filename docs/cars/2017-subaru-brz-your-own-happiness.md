It had been five years since I had owned a track car, it was the early months of
the COVID-19 pandemic, I was languishing, and my wife said

> ‟You need to do something, **you need to make your own happiness**”

I needed to do something for myself, to have my own thing. I started looking for a fun
rear-wheel drive sports coupe, either an 86 or BRZ. I considered the Miata, but it wasn't
for me. After a six-month search I found a used Crystal White Pearl late-model
Kouki (2017-2020) BRZ on the Subaru Certified Pre-Owned web portal. The car was at
a dealership in Annapolis Maryland.

I called them and immediately put down a cash deposit. I rented a car and
drove 11 hours on a Friday night, starting at 10pm, arriving at 9am Saturday
morning. The car was in great condition, and lucky for me, this was _just_ before
COVID-19 caused used-car prices to skyrocket. I bought the car the same day and drove
it home.

The car has handled 40+ track days like a champ, with only a few minor issues.
It’s making 188 wheel horsepower, keeping reliability and affordability in check.
Most importantly, it’s fulfilling its intended role as a driver’s car.

The car itself isn't what makes me happy, its the _involvement_ in
creating the vision come to life—the _participation_ in motorsports,
and of course the people and friends I make along the way. The project that
makes _my own happiness_. What makes yours?
