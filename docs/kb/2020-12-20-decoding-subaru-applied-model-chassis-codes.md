If you've ever heard anyone refer to their 86 as a "ZN6", "ZC6", or "ZN8",
then you've heard it.  If you've ever heard people talk about their Nissan 240SX
or Silvia as an S13, S14, or S15 then you've heard it. If you've ever heard them
refer to their Honda Civic as an "EF" or "EG hatch", then you've heard it. If 
you've heard BMW 3-series owners saying "E30" or "E92" then you've heard it.
They're referring to the first two letters of the applied model code.

The Applied Model (also called a Chassis Code) is a 7-digit code number that is
used by Subaru to identify a car’s specification, but unlike the Chassis Number 
or VIN, this does not uniquely identify an individual car. Almost all Subaru 
cars have the Applied Model stamped on a metal plate that can be found riveted 
to the top of the near-side strut tower, although some cars have the plate in 
one of the front door frames.

The information encoded within the Applied Model number contains details of the
vehicle’s model, body type, engine type, gearbox, trim-level and period of 
production.

Each letter in the applied model designates a code:



| Code | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| **series** | Model in the Subaru lineup, e.g. Impreza, Legacy, Forrester |
| **body style** | body style describes coupe, sedan, wagon, hatchback |
| **engine** | engine type |
| **model year** | the production year and month |
| **\# of doors** | number of doors |
| **trim** | specific equipment package and accessories |
| **transmission** | transmission type, e.g. manual or automatic and number of speeds |


## Series Code

The **Series** code is the first letter, it tells you which model in the Subaru lineup it belongs to:

| Code | Model |
| :--- | :---- |
| A | Leone/Loyale
| B | Legacy |
| C | SVX |
| G | Impreza, XV, Outback Sport |
| F | Domingo |
| K | Justy/Rex/Vivio/Sambar (Before 1998) |
| N | Trezia |
| R | Pleo, R1, R2, Stella |
| S | Forester |
| T | Sambar (After 1998) |
| V | WRX |
| W | Tribeca/Ascent |
| Y | Exiga |
| Z | BRZ |

Thus, the BRZ starts with 'Z'.


## Applied Model Code

The **Applied model** is the first-two letters combined, it is what people 
commonly refer to when trying to most accurately designate their vehicle:
 
| Code | Brand & Model |
| :--- | :------------ |
| ZN | Scion FR-S (Before 2017) 2013-2016 |
| ZN | Toyota 86, Toyota GT86 2013-2020 |

## Engine code

been one engine across all markets.

| 6 | 2.0L DOHC RWD (Naturally Aspirated) (`FA20D`) |
| 8 | 2.4L DOHC RWD (Naturally Aspirated) (`FA24D`) |

## Model Year

The model year is the date of production, often times these start the year prior
to the marketed year. This is because production of a vehicle starts early, and
sales follow.

| A | 2012/03 - 2013/09 | Zenki (2012-2015) |

| E | 2016/07 - 2017/03 | Kouki (2016-2020): new facelift for both BRZ & 86, more horsepower, track modes: increased throttle response, disables traction control. Marketed as the "2017 BRZ" in the US. |
| F | 2017/10 - 2018/09 | |
| G | 2018/09 - 2019/03 | |
| H | 2019/04 - 2020 2020 | is the final model year of the ZN6/ZC6 platform |
