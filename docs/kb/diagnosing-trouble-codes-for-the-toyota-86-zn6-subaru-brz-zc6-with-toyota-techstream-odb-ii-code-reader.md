Toyota Techstream is diagnostic software that allows you to diagnose and troubleshoot issues with Toyota and some Subaru vehicles. It reads and clears diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that are stored in the vehicle's on-board computer. It also provides access to various functions and systems in the vehicle, such as the engine control system, transmission system, and ABS (anti-lock brake system), so that technicians can perform tests and make adjustments as needed.

To read codes with Toyota Techstream, you will need to connect a ODB-II to USB cable to the vehicle's ODB-II port. The technician will then start the Techstream software and follow the prompts to access the diagnostic functions of the vehicle. Once the diagnostic functions are accessed, the technician can retrieve the stored DTCs and use them to diagnose and fix the issue with the vehicle.

Subaru SSM4 is Toyota's equivalent of Techstream, their dealer tool to read, set and manipulate values in the ECU, but there isn't much difference of the capabilities.
