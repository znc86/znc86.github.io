- Tighten bolts and nuts securely.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>⚠️ Attention</summary>

- The descriptions in this manual are intended for automobile mechanics or persons with basic knowledge of maintenance.
- Please do not attempt to install this product by inexperienced persons only, as it may cause injury or vehicle trouble while driving, and is dangerous.
- For proper installation and proper functioning of the product, it is recommended that the product be installed at a Subaru authorized factory.
- Please be sure to follow the instructions in this manual in accordance with the service manual for the vehicle model concerned issued by SUBARU Corporation.
- Tighten the bolts to the specified torque. Tightening the bolts/nuts outside the specified torque may cause damage or loosening of the bolts/nuts.

</details>

### 5. Simultaneous replacement, non-reusable parts

None

### 6. Work Procedure

Getting Started:

- This work should be performed by two or more persons.
- Before installation, wipe off any dirt or oil film on the trunk lid with a rag moistened with a degreaser (recommended nonane).
- When installing a new trunk lid, it is necessary to drill holes in the panel.
- This manual describes the left side of the trunk lid.
- Perform the work on the right side as well.
- Use a hole saw without a shavings removal function. If the hole saw has a shavings release function, use it in such a way that the shavings release function does not work.
- If the shavings release function is present, cutting shavings may enter the trunk lid, causing abnormal noise and rusting.
- Use a hole saw with a tip drill length of 10 mm or less. (Fig. 1)
