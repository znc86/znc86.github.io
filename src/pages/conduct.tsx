        <p>
          <strong>TL;DR</strong>
          Make friends not enemies. Strive for kindness, be polite, assume
          others are acting in good faith, be gracious when others are not. Do
          not tolerate assholes, negativity, report harassment and hate. Act
          like you ºll meet these people face-to-face tomorrow.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Diversity: Everyone is Welcome</strong>
          We are inclusive and committed to being a community that everyone
          feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy
          everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.
